Hi, I am a M.S student at Korea University in Information Security, working as a part of <a class=aboutme href="http://signal.korea.ac.kr">Signal Processing and Advance Intelligence Lab</a>, advised by Prof. Ji Won Yoon. I am interested in Signal Processing and Machine Learning. Generally, my research interests include Electrical Network Frequency (ENF) and for camera forensics, side/covert channel, and computer vision. I am supported by BK21 Scholarships.

Previously, I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electrical Engineering at Korea University, where I was fortunate to be a recipient of a lot of Scholarships.
