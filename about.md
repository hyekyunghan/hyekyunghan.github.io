Hi, I am a M.S student at Korea University in Information Security, working as a part of <a class=aboutme href="http://signal.korea.ac.kr">Signal Processing and Advance Intelligence Lab</a>, advised by <a class=aboutme href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=jDLHy60AAAAJ&view_op=list_works">Prof. Ji Won Yoon</a>. I am interested in Signal Processing and Machine Learning. Generally, my research interests include Electrical Network Frequency (ENF) which can be used as an important factor incorporated into various fields such as power grid stability, information security, and camera forensics. Also i have been studied in side channel analysis along with covert channel. Recently, I am into detecting deepfakes either by computer vision or signal processing. During my master's degree, I am supported by BK21 Scholarships.

Previously, I received my Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering at Korea University, where I was fortunate to be a recipient of lots of Scholarships.
